The scope of this project is in line with the global effort for rapid response time to natural hazards. Our proposal aims to create a platform for easy detection of landslides features and to transfer these features into a risk mapping model. To achieve this, we plan to use high-resolution aerial images and geocoded videos (full motion video) collected after a recent occurrence of a landslide. During the project, we want to experiment how feasible is to identify detailed features of a landslide (like scarp, body, channel, toe) by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This detection with CNNs makes use of aerial imagery obtained from optical cameras, but also thermal cameras and the fusion of these two. After the landslides feature detection, the experiment will continue for human mapping exposure to the landslide process in near real-time, within 24 hours from the start of the survey.
